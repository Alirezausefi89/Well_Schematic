# Well_Schematic
This code shows a schematic of the drilled well along with drilling progress against time. The weight and loss of drilling mud are also included in this code.
The input to this code is an Excel file that is arranged in two sheets. The first page specifies the general characteristics of the well, such as its coordinates and name, the formations drilled, and the casing shoe points. The second sheet records the progress of the drilling operation from start to finish, any dro;;ing events such as mud loss and gain, mud weights and so on.
